# Visual Django

Inspired by Borland Delphi.

Visual tools for working with Django projects (https://www.djangoproject.com)

## IDE

Plan is to have these visual tools:

 * New Project Templates
   * Empty project
   * Blog project
   * Content Web Site
   * 1-Page Application
   
 * Project Navigator
   * Django Project properties (settings)
   * Applications editor
   * URLs designer
   
 * Models Designer
   * App -> Models View & Edit
   * Human UI for Model fields with help
   
 * View -> Template Visual Editor
   * like TForm in Delphi
   * Queries editor for view
   * Output variables (what View returns)
   * Template visual editor (inputs, sections - header, detail, list, footer)
   
 * Database Viewer
 
 * Package Visual Django as an executable with PyInstaller
